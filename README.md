## Introduction

SteamOS is a Debian-based Linux operating system designed for gaming. VirtualBox is a powerful tool for creating and managing virtual machines. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up SteamOS in VirtualBox, allowing you to enjoy your favorite games in a virtual environment.

You can find the latest releases of this guide [here](https://github.com/LakshyaShukla07/SteamOS-Guide-To-VM/releases). Download the files and execute them to get started!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A computer with a supported operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- VirtualBox installed. You can download it from [VirtualBox's official site](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
- A copy of the SteamOS ISO file. You can find it on the official SteamOS website.

### System Requirements

- At least 4 GB of RAM.
- A processor with virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V).
- Sufficient disk space (at least 20 GB for the virtual machine).

## Installation Steps

1. **Download VirtualBox**: If you haven't installed VirtualBox yet, download it from [VirtualBox's official site](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

2. **Install VirtualBox**: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. **Download SteamOS**: Get the latest SteamOS ISO file from the official website.

4. **Create a New Virtual Machine**:
   - Open VirtualBox.
   - Click on "New".
   - Name your VM (e.g., SteamOS).
   - Select "Linux" as the type and "Debian" as the version.

5. **Allocate Resources**:
   - Assign at least 4 GB of RAM.
   - Create a virtual hard disk (VDI) with at least 20 GB of space.

6. **Configure Settings**:
   - Go to "Settings" for your VM.
   - Under "System", enable EFI (special OSes only).
   - Under "Storage", select the empty CD icon and choose the SteamOS ISO file.

7. **Start the Virtual Machine**: Click "Start" to boot your VM. Follow the on-screen instructions to install SteamOS.

8. **Complete Installation**: Once the installation is complete, reboot the VM and remove the ISO from the virtual drive.

## Configuration

After installation, you may want to configure SteamOS for optimal performance:

1. **Update SteamOS**: Run the update command in the terminal to ensure you have the latest packages.

2. **Install Additional Drivers**: Depending on your hardware, you may need to install specific drivers for better performance.

3. **Adjust Display Settings**: If you encounter display issues, tweak the settings in VirtualBox. You can increase the video memory and enable 3D acceleration.

4. **Network Configuration**: Ensure your VM is connected to the internet. Check the network settings in VirtualBox and set it to "Bridged Adapter" for better connectivity.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **VM Won't Start**: Check if virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI settings.
- **Poor Performance**: Ensure that you have allocated enough resources to the VM.
- **Network Issues**: Verify your network settings in VirtualBox.

### Helpful Commands

- To update packages:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```

- To install drivers:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install <driver-package-name>
  ```
